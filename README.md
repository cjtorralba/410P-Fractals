## Portland State University, Spring 2023

### [FPToolkit](https://github.com/robpelayo/La_Grange/blob/master/FPToolkit.c)
The FPToolkit file is a folder containing a very primitive API that helps create graphics applications.
### Purpose
This class is a mixture of math, art, and computer programming. Learning basic algorithms for drawing objects in a 2D plane is 
beneficial to being able to draw real fractals.
